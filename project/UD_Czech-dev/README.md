# Summary

The Czech UD treebank is based on the Prague Dependency Treebank 3.0 (PDT),
created at the Charles University in Prague.


# Introduction

The treebank consists of 87,913 sentences (1.5 M tokens) and its domain is
mainly newswire, reaching also to business and popular scientific articles
from the 1990s. The treebank is licensed under the terms of
[CC BY-NC-SA 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/)
and its original (non-UD) version can be downloaded from

The morphological and syntactic annotation of the Czech UD treebank is created
through a conversion of PDT data. The conversion procedure has been designed by
Dan Zeman and implemented in Treex.

# Domains and Data Split

NOTE: Earlier releases of the treebank had four training data files. This was
due to Github restrictions on file size. We have now re-joined the training
files in the official release package (beginning with UD v1.3), so there is
just one training file as in all other languages, and it is named
cs-ud-train.conllu. The four files in previous releases corresponded to the
four sources of the original texts; the sources may still be distinguished,
if desirable, by the prefixes of sentence ids. All of them are newspapers, but

* l (ln) and m (mf) are mainstream daily papers (news, commentaries, but also
  sports results and TV programs)
* c (cmpr) is a business weekly
* v (vesm) contains popular scientific articles (the hardest to parse: long
  sentences and unusual vocabulary)

The dev and test sets contain all four sources and their size is proportional
to the sizes of the respective training parts.


# Changelog

* 2017-11-15 v2.1
  * Retagged pronouns “každý” and “kterýžto”.
  * Prepositional objects are now “obl:arg” instead of “obj”.
  * Instrumental phrases for demoted agents in passives are now “obl:agent”.
* 2017-03-01 v2.0
  * Converted to UD v2 guidelines.
  * Reconsidered PRON vs. DET. Extended PronType and Poss.
  * Improved advmod vs. obl distinction.
  * L-participles are verbs, other participles are adjectives.
  * Removed style flags from lemmas.
* 2016-05-15 v1.3
  * Fixed adverbs that were attached as nmod; correct: advmod.
  * Copulas with clausal complements are now heads.
  * Improved conversion of AuxY.
  * Relation of foreign prepositions changed to foreign.
* 2015-11-15 v1.2
  * Conversion procedure rewritten again (may result in minor differences in
    borderline cases)
  * Only one “root” relation per tree now enforced; some bugs around root fixed
  * The “name” relation goes now always left-to-right (in UD 1.1 it was family-
    to-given name)
  * Fixed bug with numeral-noun swapping that destroyed coordinations of
    numbers and caused the “conj” relation to go right-to-left
  * Fixed minor bugs around subordinating conjunctions
  * Changed dependency relation of reflexive pronouns attached to inherently
    reflexive verbs from compound:reflex to expl
  * Applied heuristics to distinguish at least some iobj from dobj
  * Fixed bugs around xcomp (future infinitives and subjects attached to
    controlled verbs)
* 2015-05-15 v1.1
  * Conversion procedure completely rewritten
  * Improved heuristics to distinguish DET and PRON
  * Improved treatment of comparative complements (conjunctions “než” and “jako”)
  * Remaining lemma extensions moved from LEMMA to MISC
